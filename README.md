## Volumes
- To persist container data. Example: make data persistent in DB.
- Normally, k8s doesn't manage data persistance. 

**Deployment**
In real case, you don't create pods. you create deployment where you define how many pods to create.
To avoid data inconsistance `StatefulSet` is used by DB container services.
